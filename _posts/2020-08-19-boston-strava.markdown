On lockdown from COVID-19 and having just defended my dissertation, I've found myself with some unexpected (but welcomed) spare time. So, I decided to explore Mapbox's [Interactive Storytelling][mapbox-storytelling] template and attempt to build a cartographic narrative on the theme of 'accessibility of public parks in the context of COVID-19'.

I had moderate familiarity with Mapbox before this undertaking, but have background in GIScience-- primarily using ERSI's ArcGIS suite. I'm a complete novice with JavaScript. I tackled a few projects simultaneously-- first was to build this GitHub account and page. Second was to refamiliarize myself with Mapbox and the new Storytelling template. Third was to develop the narrative for my first exploratory story using the template. It was an iterative process that took a few days.  

Next time, I'll definitely spend more time constructing/ refining the story before diving into the coding. I'm sure a storytelling map is only as good as the actual story it's telling, so it'll be important to get it right.

Take a look at the final product and let me know what you think: [Equity in Park Access During COVID-19][mapbox-access].
